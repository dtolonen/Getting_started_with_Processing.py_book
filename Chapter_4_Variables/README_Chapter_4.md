## Chapter 4 / Variables

- One of the reasons we use variables is to avoid repeating our- selves in the code. E.g. when you turn the coordinate and diameter details for circles into variables, the same values can be used for multiple ellipses. Otherwise, you'd have to change the coordinate and diameter code in multiple places. This also allows you to experiment with alternatives quickly.
- Processing has a series of special variables to store information about the program while it runs. For instance, the width and height of the window are stored in variables called width and height. These values are set by the size() function. They can be used to draw elements relative to the size of the window, even if the size() line changes. Other special variables keep track of the status of the mouse and keyboard values and much more (Chapter 5).
- The ultimate power of working with a for loop is the ability to make quick changes to the code. Because the code inside the block is typically run multiple times, a change to the block is magnified when the code is run.
