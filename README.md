- Read the book: [Getting Started with Processing.py](https://www.makershed.com/products/getting-started-with-processing-py-pdf)

- What is Processing? See [Hello Processing!](https://hello.processing.org) (note: this quick video tutorial uses the original Java syntax, not Python, but is similar enough to show off how Processing works)

- Processing: [Reference page for Python functions](https://py.processing.org/reference/)
