## Chapter 9 / Functions

<summary markdown="span">Click here for notes and new functions found in this chapter</summary>

- This chapter shows how to write new functions to extend the capabilities of Processing beyond its built-in features.
- Focus on the higher-level goal (such as drawing a tree), and not the details of the implementation (the line() commands that define the tree shape). Once a function is defined, the code inside the function need not be repeated again.
- Parameters are an important part of functions, because they provide flexibility. For instance, the parameters to the line() function make it pos- sible to draw a line from any pixel on screen to any other pixel. Without the parameters, the function would be able to draw a line only from one fixed point to another.
- Each parameter is a variable that gets created each time the function runs. Each value is passed into the function and then wherever the variable name appears within the function, it’s replaced with the incoming value.
- It’s possible to keep adding more and more parameters to the function to change different aspects of how the owl is drawn. Values could be passed in to change the owl’s color, rotation, scale, or the diameter of its eyes.
- Return values: Functions can make a calculation and then return a value to the main program. A function that returns a value is also frequently used as a parameter to another function. To make a function that returns a value, specify the data to be passed back with the keyword return.
